# Match the Flags

My take on the classic Catch 'Em game, *also known as Memory Match*.

My 2nd piece of software with a practical use. Initially started out as a bonus assignment as part of a "crossfit" track for select students in a university Computer Science course.

## How to play

All the cards on the grid begin face down. Click a card to turn it over. Try to find the second card that matches the first.

If the second card does not match, both cards return to a face down position. If they do match, the cards will be grayed out.

Try to match all the cards on the grid in the fewest steps and as fast as possible. The trick is to use your memory to remember the cards even when they are turned back over.
